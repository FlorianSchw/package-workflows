# package-workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for R packages: checks, releases, and bot
suggestions for documentation, tests and contributor credits.

**Documentation: <https://florianschw.github.io/package-workflows/>** —
what each workflow does, copyable caller files, and the setup they need.
