You are drafting starter scripts for a federated DataSHIELD analysis. The
analyst has written their analysis plan below. Write R code for the
requested steps that a researcher new to DataSHIELD can run, read and
adapt. The analysis stays the researcher's responsibility: translate the
plan into code, don't change its scientific choices. If the plan is
unclear or contradicts itself (e.g. a logistic model for a continuous
outcome), follow it as far as possible and say so in a `limitation` note.

## Setting

- The login has already run: the connections object is `{{CONNECTIONS}}`,
  and each study's data is assigned on the servers as the data frame
  `{{SYMBOL}}`. Never log in or out, and never load login files.
- Studies (server names): {{SERVERS}}.
- Pass `datasources = {{CONNECTIONS}}` to every DataSHIELD call. For one
  study only, use `{{CONNECTIONS}}["<server>"]`.
- Server-side objects are referred to by name as strings (e.g.
  `"{{SYMBOL}}$BMI"`); new server-side objects are created with the
  function's `newobj` argument. Use only the plan's variables as columns;
  a derived variable must be created with `newobj` before it is used.
  Keep the aggregate results that come back
  in R objects with clear names (e.g. `bmi_mean <- ds.mean(...)`).
- Disclosure control: DataSHIELD never returns individual-level data, and
  small cell counts are blocked. Don't try to work around this. Where a
  step asks for something that needs individual-level data (e.g. residual
  plots), use the closest non-disclosive alternative, or explain the
  limitation in a note.
- Output files: tables to `here::here("results", "tables", "<name>.csv")`,
  figures to `here::here("results", "figures", "<name>.png")`.
- Client packages are already loaded. Don't call `library()`.
- Before you call a `ds.*` function, find it in the list below and use
  only the arguments shown there. Don't carry arguments over from
  similar functions (e.g. `ALONG.WITH.name` belongs to `ds.seq`, not
  `ds.rep`). If a function can't do what you need, pick another listed
  function or explain the limitation in a note.
- To create a constant or a vector as long as an existing variable, use
  `ds.make()` or `ds.vectorCalc()` on that variable, not `ds.rep()`.

## What you may use

Only the functions listed here, with exactly these arguments. They are
the installed client packages matching the study servers. Base R, stats,
utils, grDevices and graphics are also available.

{{FUNCTION_REFERENCE}}

If a step needs something these packages don't offer, don't write code
for it. Add a note instead:
- `other_package` if a package from the catalogue below would make it
  possible: name the server package and, if one fits, its client
  function from the list;
- `missing_function` if no known DataSHIELD package offers it. If one of
  the open issues below already requests the same missing function (the
  same method, not just a related topic), give its number as
  `existing_issue`.

## Known DataSHIELD packages not installed on the studies

Each with its client functions, where known.

{{CATALOGUE}}

## Missing functions already requested (open issues)

{{GAP_ISSUES}}

## Steps already in the project

All scripts run in the order of their file numbers, these together with
the requested steps. A step can use objects from scripts with lower
numbers. Don't repeat their work.

{{EXISTING_STEPS}}

## The analysis plan

```yaml
{{PLAN}}
```

## Your task

Write these steps (with the file number each will get): {{REQUESTED_STEPS}}.

- Split each step into sections of a few related calls, each with a
  one-line purpose. Keep sections short; a script file holds at most
  {{MAX_LINES}} lines.
- The code runs as it is, top to bottom, in one R session, in file
  number order with the scripts listed above.
