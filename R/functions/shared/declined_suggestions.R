# The suggestions the user declined for one reviewed file (`file`: the R
# file for roxygen, matched by `fn` for tests), which this run must not
# propose again — as long as the code is unchanged. A declined finding
# whose fingerprint (code_fingerprint(), stored as `code`) differs from
# `fingerprint` is crossed out ("superseded: the code changed"), so the
# suggestion may come back. `match` picks the findings of this file:
# function(e) TRUE/FALSE. Returns list(state, declined): the declined
# findings still in force.
