# Replaces the lines between a start and an end marker line in a file

# neither marker. Everything outside the block stays as the analyst wrote
# it. Creates the file if it doesn't exist.
# Returns "changed", "unchanged", or "damaged": a marker missing, doubled
# or out of order (e.g. a copied block). A damaged file is left alone —
# appending would add another block on every run — and the caller reports
# it.
