# Installs a DataSHIELD package at a given version and returns what was
# installed: list(package, requested, installed, ref, note). A package
# already installed at that version (a cached or preinstalled library) is
# kept as it is. Most DataSHIELD packages are only on GitHub, so the
# sources are tried in this order (dev-notes/analysis-suggest.md,
# "Package versions"):
#   1. CRAN (incl. archive), if the catalogue lists a CRAN link;
#   2. a GitHub tag "v<version>", then "<version>";
#   3. the GitHub default branch — its version is then compared.
# A version that doesn't match, or no install at all, becomes a note for
# the report (wording from `texts$notes`); the run goes on with what is
# installed.
