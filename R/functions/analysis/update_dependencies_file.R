# Updates the bot's block in dependencies.R (dependencies_block()),
# between `markers$dependencies_start` and `markers$dependencies_end`.
# Packages "not yet on the servers" come from this run's notes
# (`other_packages`, server package names; their clients are added by
# name) plus those the block already lists: their steps may not have been
# requested this time. They stay until the servers have them.
# Returns update_marked_block()'s result ("changed", "unchanged",
# "damaged").
