# Tool schema for the analysis scripts. Claude returns each requested step
# as sections of plain code plus notes; R assembles the script files,
# checks the calls and runs them. Enums keep the answer inside what exists:
# step ids from the plan (`step_ids`, only the steps asked for) and, for
# "possible with another package" notes, package names from the catalogue
# (`catalogue_names`, retired packages already removed) and client
# function names from the function catalogue (`catalogue_functions`).
# Whether the function belongs to that package is checked afterwards
# (verify_note_functions()).
