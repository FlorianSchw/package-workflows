# Deterministic assembly: the ONLY place test_that() blocks are built, from
# Claude's structured fields. Same principle as roxygen-suggest's
# build_roxygen_block() — Claude never produces final syntax directly.
# Returns a NAMED character vector of complete test_that() block strings
# (one per item in `tests`), named by the test's original (unescaped)
# description — the same string testthat itself will report back after
# running, so callers can match pass/fail results back to specific blocks
# without re-parsing generated source. NOT yet run, NOT yet written to disk.
