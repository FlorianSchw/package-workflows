# Threshold for roxygen suggestions (see dev-notes/suggestion-thresholds.md):
# a field Claude changed is accepted only if its stated reason is in
# accept_reasons AND its text differs from the existing one by more than
# whitespace, punctuation or case. Fields Claude changed without listing
# them aren't accepted either. Returns `accepted` (field keys), plus
# `applied` and `dropped` change records (field, reason, explanation,
# proposed text, and for dropped ones why) for the PR description; every
# dropped change is also logged.
