# Builds the Claude tool-call JSON schema for submit_tests. Same
# deterministic-assembly principle as roxygen-suggest's
# build_submit_review_tool(): Claude returns discrete fields (never
# assembled test_that() syntax), the R script does the actual stitching.
# The cap on new tests is enforced structurally via maxItems
# (max_new_tests in config/claude.yml), not just prompt wording.
#
# Each new test carries a `reason` from a fixed list; filter_generated_tests()
# keeps only the accepted reasons. "other" is the honest way out for a test
# that adds no real value. Decisions on existing tests (update / delete /
# report) are checked by review_existing_tests() — see
# dev-notes/suggestion-thresholds.md.
#
# **The same for every function of a run** (dev-notes/claude-costs.md): the
# tool definition comes first in the request, before the prompt part that
# is cached (split_cached_prompt()), so any per-function difference here
# would invalidate the cache for every call. Hence no per-function enums:
# the function's test file names (`test_file`) and the ids of earlier
# findings (`repeats_earlier`, `earlier_findings`) are plain strings, and R
# checks every value Claude returns — an unknown file or id is ignored
# (sort_test_decisions(), merge_test_findings(),
# handle_failed_new_test()). What may vary is per run only:
# - `dslite_datasets`: config/dslite-canned-datasets.json$datasets when the
#   run may create a DSLite setup, else NULL. The enum covers all of them;
#   the prompt offers them only for a function that gets a fresh setup, and
#   the entry script uses the choice only then;
# - `categories` (detect_test_scheme(), categorised repositories only): a
#   category per new test.
# A new test file can get top-level setup and teardown code
# (new_test_file_content()).
