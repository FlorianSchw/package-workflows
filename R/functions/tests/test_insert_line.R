# Where new tests go in an existing test file: the line after which they
# are inserted, or NULL to append at the end. Files that clean up at the
# end — dsBaseClient's `test_that("shutdown", …)` followed by a top-level
# disconnect — must get new tests before that, or they run without a
# connection. So new tests go after the last test_that() block that is
# not a clean-up block (shutdown, teardown, cleanup, disconnect, done)
# whenever a clean-up block or other code follows it; otherwise at the
# end. `blocks` comes from parse_test_file().
