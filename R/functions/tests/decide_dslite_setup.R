# - "auto": only if the tests show no approach to connecting at all;
# - "create": unless the tests already use DSLite (e.g. during a switch
#   from Opal to DSLite);
# - "never": never.
# Returns "create" (generate a setup), "reuse" (follow how the existing
# tests connect) or "none" (nothing to connect with: the function is
# reported, not tested). `approaches` comes from
# detect_connection_approaches().
