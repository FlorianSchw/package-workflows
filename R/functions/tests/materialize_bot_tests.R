# With an open bot PR, puts the test files its branch (`bot_ref`,
# fetch_bot_branch()) changes into the working tree before the run — the
# tests it already proposes, a generated setup file, new category files.
# They then count as existing: they are run and shown to Claude, so the
# same tests aren't generated again (the roxygen counterpart is
# review_source_block()). A file the user changed since the last review
# (`base_rev`) keeps their version, as in the bot branch's merge
# (`-X theirs`). "Changed by the bot" means changed on the bot branch since
# its merge base with the reviewed branch. Returns list(materialized,
# user_edited) — paths; restore_unproposed_files() puts back the ones
# this run doesn't propose.
