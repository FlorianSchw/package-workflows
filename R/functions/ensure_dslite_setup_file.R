# Lazily creates a DSLite test setup once per package when a client-side
# function needs DSLite and detect_dslite_setup() found no DSLite setup in
# any setup*/helper* file. Writes tests/testthat/setup.R if there is none
# (fewest files, the usual convention); if a setup.R exists without
# DSLite (e.g. other fixtures), writes setup-dslite.R instead, so that
# file is never touched — testthat runs every setup*.R (a name must start
# with "setup"). Revisable, see dev-notes/test-suggest.md. Safe to
# call once per processed function: after the first write,
# detect_dslite_setup() finds it and this isn't called again.
