# Actually runs the just-written test file via testthat and reports

# generated test must actually be run before being trusted" step. The

# without that, every test fails in a fresh CI process with "could not
# find function". Returns a list of list(description, passed, message) —
# message is NA for passing tests, the failure/error text otherwise.
