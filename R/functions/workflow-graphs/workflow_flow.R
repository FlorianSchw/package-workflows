# One workflow's part of a situation diagram (situation_diagram()): its
# outcomes `outs` (workflow_outcomes(), fitted by situation_outcomes()) and
# the arrows between its box, those outcomes and the workflows it starts
# (`chains`). Outcomes follow the order of the jobs that produce them: a
# job that needs another starts from that job's outcomes, labelled with
# the result it waits for ("if check fails"); a job without outcomes of
# its own passes its incoming arrows through; a chain starts from the
# outcome its sending job depends on. A condition on every arrow leaving
# the box is returned as `box_note` and dropped from those arrows.
# Returns list(outcome_text, edges, box_note): `outcome_text` a named list,
# key "file|job|i" -> wording; `edges` a list of list(from, to, label,
# dotted), with outcome keys or Mermaid IDs (the box, started workflows).
