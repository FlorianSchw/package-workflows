# Updates the generated blocks of .github/workflow-graphs/README.md and
# leaves everything else alone. A block sits between
# `<!-- workflow-graphs:<id>:start -->` and `<!-- workflow-graphs:<id>:end -->`
# and is found by its ID, not its position, so text written around it
# stays as the user left it. `blocks` is a named list, ID -> content lines.
# A block whose ID is no longer generated (e.g. the per-workflow
# "detail:<file>" blocks of earlier versions) is removed, together with a
# blank line after it; new blocks are added at the end. `lines` is the
# current README (NULL if there is none — then `starter` builds the whole
# file once). Returns the new lines.
