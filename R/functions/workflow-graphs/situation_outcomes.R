# A workflow's outcomes (workflow_outcomes()) as they matter in one
# situation — `trigger` is its GitHub event name ("schedule"). A condition
# about the event itself ("only if: scheduled run") decides: on another
# event the outcome is left out ("Scheduled workflows kept enabled" isn't
# shown for a pull request), on its own event the condition goes without
# saying and is dropped; likewise "skipped: <this event>" leaves the
# outcome out. Other conditions stay. Returns the remaining outcomes.
