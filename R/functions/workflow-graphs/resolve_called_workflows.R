# Follows the reusable workflows the repository's workflows call, all the
# way down (a called workflow may call further ones), to collect what each
# call sends in the end (workflow_dispatches()). Each distinct reference is
# read once; a reference already seen is not followed again (loop guard),
# and nothing deeper than `max_depth` is read. Composite actions used in
# steps are not opened — a dispatch sent from inside one is not found.
# Returns a named list, reference key -> list(ref, readable, dispatches,
# workflow), where `dispatches` includes everything sent further down and
# `workflow` is the parsed called file (for outcomes and conditions; NULL if
# not readable).
