# Removes two headings the starter text of earlier versions wrote around
# the generated block, which the block now brings itself or no longer
# needs — only in exactly that shape, so nothing written by hand goes:
# "## Overview" directly followed by the overview block (the block starts
# with "## All workflows" now), and "## Workflows" with nothing below it
# (the per-workflow diagrams it introduced are gone). `lines` is the
# README; returns it, cleaned.
