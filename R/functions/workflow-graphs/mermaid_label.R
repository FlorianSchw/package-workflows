# A diagram box label from lines of text: each line escaped
# (mermaid_text()) and wrapped at `width` characters, all joined with
# <br/>. The wrapping is done here because GitHub's Mermaid gives boxes a
# fixed width and cuts off what doesn't fit instead of growing the box.
# Long words without spaces (repository paths, file names) are broken
# after "/", and only where that isn't enough after "-", so
# "FlorianSchw/package-workflows" becomes "FlorianSchw/" +
# "package-workflows". NULL / NA / "" lines are skipped.
